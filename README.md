# ADC library

Library developed with microcontroller MSP430FR4133, with this library you can get the value of any analog device. The sensors are powered with a digital switch composed of transistors connected to a battery. In the main program, we can see an example of different conversions of sensors decagon EC5 and MPX5700 and also a conversion of the battery used to power the device.
